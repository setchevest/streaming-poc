## Brief overview
Guidelines for translating code files from to English, ensuring all user-facing text is localized while preserving technical functionality, variables, and commands.

## File types
- Translate all .sh (shell script), .md (markdown) files, including comments, echo messages, and user instructions
- Focus on human-readable text while maintaining code structure and functionality

## Translation approach
- Convert all comments, messages, and instructions to English
- Preserve technical terms, variable names, command syntax, and URLs in their original form
- Maintain consistent terminology and tone throughout translated content

## Quality checks
